<p>The red wave at the top is the resultant wave. The result of the two other waves added together.</p>

<p>In real life, the white waves would technically be on top of each other, but that wouldn't make for a good user interface, so the waves are shown separated.<p>

<p>Press the <b>Add wave</b> button to add a wave</p>
<p>Set the <math>A</math> of a wave to 0 to remove it</p>

<p> The variables you can control, from the top are: </p>

<ul>
    <li> <p> <math>\phi</math>: the wave's phase shift </p> </li>
    <li> <p> <math>A</math>: the wave's amplitude. Note that down is positive in this simulation. </p> </li>
    <li> <p> <math>v</math>: the wave's velocity </p> </li>
    <li> <p> <math>\lambda</math>: the wave's wavelength </p> </li>
</ul>

<h2> The math </h2>

<p> The resultant wave is simply the sum of the other waves. </p>

<math> W_{net}(x, t) = \sum W(x, t) </math>

<p> A wave is defined as a function of position and time. </p>

<math> W(x, t) = A \sin \left (\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}(\phi + x - vt) \right ) </math>

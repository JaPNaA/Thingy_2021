    A uniform circular motion simulation of an object in a uniform magetic field.
    The magnetic field is pointing out of the screen.
</p>

<p>You can manipulate variables on top left</p>

<h2>The Math</h2>
<p>The force from the magnetic field can be represeted by:</p>
<math>\vec F_m = q\vec v \times \vec B</math>

<p> Because we know that the object is moving in a uniform circle and the magnetic field is always pointing out of the screen, we don't need to worry about the direction. </p>
<math>F_m = qvB</math>

<p>We can use Newton's Second Law to tie the magnetic force and uniform circular motion equations to find the velocity of the particle.</p>

<math>F_m = ma</math>
<math>qvB = m\frac{v^2}{r}</math>
<math>qB = m\frac{v}{r}</math>
<math>qBr = mv</math>
<math>\frac{qBr}{m} = v</math>

    Note: that the acceleration vector's magnitude is not to scale.
    If we were to have made them to scale, the vector would be too small to see compared to their orbit.

    The dropdown box allows you to select different planets that will change the mass and radius of circle the orbit size is based on the height of the satellite. Note: that all inputs can manipulated.

<h2> The Math</h2>
<p> 
    As we know the general equation for true gravitational force is
</p>
<math>
    F_g = \frac{GMm}{r^2}
</math>
<p>Since the sattelite is moving in a centripital motion we can use Newton's Second Law of motion and the equation of centripital acceleration to tie the two equations together and solve for the velocity of the sattelite</p>
<math> F_g = ma </math>
<math>\frac{GMm}{r^2} = m\frac{v^2}{r}</math>
<math>\frac{GM}{r^2} = \frac(v^2){r}</math>
<math>\frac{GM}{r} = v^2</math>
<math>\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}} = v</math>

<p> Electric field generated by particles </p>

<p> The electric field shows the direction a positive test charge would be accelerated if it was in that position. </p>
<p> The vecotrs indicate the direction of electric field at its tail </p>

<p> Particle's charges are in microcoulombs </p>

<p> <b>Set value to 0</b> to delete particle </p>

<p> You can set the charge value to negative to create negative charge <p>

<p> <b>[drag]</b> to move particles </p>

<p> To add particles, <b>[click+drag]</b> on the <b> Create Particle </b> </p>


<p> Red indicates a positive charge </p>
<p> Blue indicates a negative charge </p>

<h2> The Math </h2>

<p> The magnitude of a vector on the grid vectors is determined by summing together the electric field from each particle. </p>

<p> The magnitude of the electric field from a particle at some distance away from it <math>r</math>, is determined by the equation </p>
<math> F = \frac{kqQ}{r^2} </math>

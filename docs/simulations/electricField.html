<p> Electric field generated by particles </p>

<p> The electric field shows the direction a positive test charge would be accelerated if it was in that position. </p>
<p> The vecotrs indicate the direction of electric field at its tail </p>

<p> Particle's charges are in microcoulombs </p>

<p> <b>Set value to 0</b> to delete particle </p>

<p> You can set the charge value to negative to create negative charge <p>

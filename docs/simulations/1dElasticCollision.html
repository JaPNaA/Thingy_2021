<p>
    A simple elastic collision.
</p>

<p>
    Two masses move in opposite direction and collide which each other. Each mass has a initial velocity that changes after the collision.

    Note that the collision time is not always accurate.

<h2> The Math </h2>

<p> Because this is an elastic collision, there are 2 conservation laws they blocks must follow. </p>

<p> Conservation of momentum: </p>
<math> m_1 v_1 + v_2 v_2 = m_1 v'_1 + v_2 v'_2 </math>

<p> Conservation of kinetic energy: </p>
<math> \frac{1}{2}m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2 v_2^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_1 v_1^{\prime 2} + \frac{1}{2}m_2 v_2^{\prime 2} </math>

<p> Our unknowns are <math>v'</math> and <math>v_1'</math>. There are 2 equations and 2 unknowns, so we can begin solving immediately </p>

<p> The equation to determine where the blocks would hit uses the kinematic equation </p>
<math> x' = vt + x </math>

<p> We have two blocks, so </p>
<math> x_0' = v_0 t + x_0 </math>
<math> x_1' = v_1 t + x_1 </math>

<p> We know that <math>x_0' = x_1'</math> when the collision occurs. </p>
<math> v_1 t + x_1 = v_0 t + x_0 </math>

<p> Solve for <math>t</math> </p>
<math> v_1 t - v_0 t = x_0 - x_1 </math>
<math> (v_1 - v_0) t = x_0 - x_1 </math>
<math> t = \frac{x_0 - x_1}{v_1 - v_0} </math>

<p> And we can determine the position by substituting <math>t</math> into one of the equations we started with. </p>
<math> x_0' = v_0 t + x_0 </math>
<math> x_0' = v_0 \cdot \frac{x_0 - x_1}{v_1 - v_0} + x_0 </math>

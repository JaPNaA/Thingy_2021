<p>
    The most simple simulation.
</p>
<p>
    The ball moves in a straight line with an initial velocity (first vector input) and a constant acceleration (second vector input).
</p>
<p>
    Holding <b>[space]</b> allows you to see its movement in real time.
</p>

<h2>The Math</h2>
<p>As stated its a simple 1d motion simulation where velocity, accleration and time is given so all we need to do is solve for the distance</p>
<math> d = v_0t + at^2</math>

This is a project created for our Physics Culminating 12 assignment.

<h2>General Controls</h2>

<h3>Camera</h3>
<p><b>[w] [a] [s] [d]</b> allows you to <b>pan</b> around slowly.</p>
<p>holding <b>[space]</b> while moving the cursor lets you <b>pan</b>.</p>
<p><b>[=]</b> or <b>[scroll up] zooms</b> into your cursor.</p>
<p><b>[-]</b> or <b>[scroll down]</b> zooms out from your cursor.</p>
<p><b>[0] reset</b>s your <b>zoom</b>.</p>

<h3>Navigation</h3>
<p>On the home screen, you'll see a list of simulations. Click on one to open it.</p>
<p>To exit a simulation, you can click the <b>[back]</b> button in the browser.</p>
<h3>Vector Inputs</h3>
<p>For 1d vectors, you can <b>drag</b> its head to increase or decrease it's magnitude.</p>
<p>You can also click on the numbers to edit them. Additional controls in Scalar Inputs.</p>
<p>For 2d vectors, you can also <b>drag</b> its head to change its magnitude and direction.</p>
<p>When hovering over a 2d vector, you'll also be able to see and edit it's components like 1d vectors.</p>

<h3>Scalar Inputs</h3>
<p>Values are only applied when you click out of the input, or press <b>[enter]</b>.</p>
<p>If you enter a non-numerical value into the input, it will reset to its previous value.</p>
<p>You can press <b>[up]</b> to increment or <b>[down]</b> to decrement the value by 1.</p>

<p>Like 1d motion, but in 2d.</p>
<p>The ball moves in a trajectory as defined by its initial velocity and initial position.</p>

<p> Gravity is set to <math>-9.8 \frac{m}{s^2} \textup{[down]}</math> initially. </p>

<p>
    Holding [space] allows you to see its movement in real time.
    You can hover over the red dot to see it's position at any time.
    Note that in this simulation, positive y is in the downward direction.
</p>

<h2>The Math</h2>
<p> The simulation uses one of the five kinematic equations. With the given information, initial velocity <math>\vec v</math>, time <math>t</math>, and acceleration <math>\vec a</math>, we can use it to find it's position at any point in time.</p>

<math> \vec d = \vec v t + \frac{1}{2}\vec at^2 </math>

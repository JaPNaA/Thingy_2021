<p> Electric field generated by particles </p>

<p> The electric field shows the direction a positive test charge would be accelerated if it was in that position. </p>
<p> The vectors indicate the direction of electric field at its tail </p>

<p> Particle's charges are in microcoulombs </p>

<p> <b>Set value to 0</b> to delete particle </p>

<p> You can set the charge value to negative to create negative charge <p>

<p> Red indicates a positive charge </p>
<p> Blue indicates a negative charge </p>

<h2> The Math </h2>

<p> The magnitude of a vector on the grid vectors is determined by summing together the electric field from each particle. </p>

<p> The magnitude of the electric field from a particle at some distance away from it <math>r</math>, is determined by the equation </p>
<math> F = k\frac{q}{r^2} </math>

<p> Where <math>q</math> is the charge of the particle, and <math>k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \textup N \cdot \frac{\textup m^2}{\textup C^2}</math> </p>

<p> The direction of the force is determined by it's charge. Positive -> away, negative -> towards. <p>
